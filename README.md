# Posting/Comment Demo - Alfredo Takori

Hello There! This my MVP for a comment/post system that which is similar to posting comments and stories on social media. This demo allows you to be able to create new posts as well as to be able to comment on previous posts. It also features a simple 'like'(Hypes) system. For this MVP, I did not allow for users to be able to comment on comments, but that could easily be implemented in future iterations.

This was a Frontend project and as such I used a combination of React Context API and React Hooks in order to simulate the backend. For something like this to exist as an acutal product, a true backend would need to be implemented.

## How To Run Locally

In order to run this app, feel free to clone the repo and run the following commands in your terminal:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

## Testing

For testing purposes I used libraries such as React Testing-Library as well as Jest. In order to run tests, go to the root directory of the repository and type the following into the terminal:

### `npm test`

## Future Features

Here are a few features that I would like to add:

-   Comment button activating comment field
-   Simulation of views increasing for posts
-   Simulation of other users commenting on submitted posts
-   Form validation for submitting posts/comments

## Technologies/libraries Used

-   Frontend Framework = React w/ Typescript
-   State Management = React Context API
-   Testing = React Testing Library \* Jest
